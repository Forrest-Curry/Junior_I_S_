# Junior I.S.
My Junior Independed Study project, that is intended to be a learning tool for understanding the basic structre of a CPU. The home page contains information about each component of a CPU that is used in the arcitecture for the game. The game itself, allows a user to drag and drop vaious CPU components on to a blank CPU arcitrecture. This helps a user understand how each component is connected and how they interact with one another.
