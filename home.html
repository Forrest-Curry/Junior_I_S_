    <h3>There are 5 main components to a CPU: Control Unit, Registers, instruction pointer, 
        instruction register, and an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</h3>
    <p> The <b>Contol Unit</b> is the brain of the operation, it takes in an instruction and 
        then subsequently tells other aspects of the CPU what to do to complete the operation. 
        These tasks can include sending data to the ALU to complete an operation, sending calls
        to registers get data or store it in a specific place</p>
    <p> An <b>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</b> preforms bit-oriented operations on data inputs. 
        The ALU takes in data called operands along with a code to tell it what operation to complete. 
        It then outputs the result. An ALU does not contain any memory and can only output the 
        result for a given input so it is important that the timing is right to receive and store 
        the output before the next computation.</p>
    <p> The <b>Registers</b> are internal memory storage for instructions, or data that is currently 
        being used in a computation. The number and length of these registers is determined by the 
        instruction set architecture for a specific CPU. The parameters of what kinds of data that 
        can be stored in these registers is also predetermined by the instruction set architecture.
        (In this case we are looking at the registers as a form of internal memory but a CPU 
        can also have it's own local cache memory separate from the predefined registers)</p>
    <p> The <b>Instruction Pointer</b> (sometimes called the program counter) stores the 
        memory location of the next instruction to be executed. This memory location is stored in the 
        external memory thus taking slightly longer to fetch than any data in the local registers. </p>
    <p> The <b>Instruction Register</b> then holds the actual instruction for the current 
        operation to be read and parsed by the control unit. </p>
